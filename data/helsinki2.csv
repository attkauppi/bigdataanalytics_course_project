Tölli on maalaisromanttinen aikamatka viattomuuden ja puhtaan agraarikulttuurin pyörteisiin nykyaikaisin twistein. Tölli on yhdistelmä suomalais-ugrilaista hobittiasumista ja urbaania hifistelyä. Tilaihme jättää hyvän maun ja kevyen kaipauksen...
Keittiö on alkukantaisen pieni ja ahdas - opettaa arvostamaan avoimia tiloja.
Olohuone on ainut osa tölliä, missä on lokoisat tilat kölliä.
Makuuhuone on pienen tai erityisen nöyrän ystävä - jo rappusten yläpäästä on kumarrettava huoneen kruununjalokivelle, sängylle. Yläkerrassa on lisäksi linnantornia hyvällä mielikuvituksella etäisesti muistuttava vaatehuone, tyrmä tai lasten kammari.
Vessa, eteinen ja patio ovat perin tärkeitä, mutta kelpaavat paremman puutteessa eurojackpottia odotellessa...

Huoneistomme sopii hyvin isolle perheelle kuin myös pienelle seurueelle.
Huoneistomme on lemmikkiystävällinen.
Sisäsiistit ja hyväkäytöksiset lemmikit ovat tervetulleita! 
Tässä huoneistossa ei ole ns. olohuonetta, löytyvät vain 3 makuuhuonetta, keittiö ja kylpyhuone. Tämä huoneisto on enemmän suunnattu nimensä mukaisesti ”matkailijoille” ja työporukoille, jotka arvostavat montaa sänkypaikkaa ja tilavuutta! :)

Huoneistomme on pala Keravan 
alkuperäistä historiaa ja paritalon ulkokuori on rakennettu n. 1928-luvulla.
Huom!!
Talo on vanha joten täytyy ymmärtää että siihen kuuluvat sijainnista aiheutuvat meluhaitat.

Paikkaansa nähden hyvin rauhallisella alueella, vaikka vilkas tie vieressä sekä junaraide menee talon aidan vierestä :) 
Kulkuyhteydet mitä parhaimmat niin Helsingiin, Helsinki-vantaa lentokentälle kuin Lahden suntaan niin junalla kuin autolla. Parkkipaikkoja löytyy useammalle autolle! 

Prisma sijaitsee aivan kadun toisella puolella ja se on auki 24h joten vaikka kuinka myöhään saavut huoneistoon, aina löytyy kauppa josta ostaa ruokaa :)

Yläkerrassa, ullakkohuoneistossa on muita airbnb vieraita mutta huoneisto on yksityinen ja iso.

I always want to welcome my guest personally and hand over the key to the apartment. If you have any additional questions during your stay you can always call or text me and I will try to solve your situation. No matter what time of the day or night.

This neighborhood is very special for the beauty of the landscape of Kaisaniemi park and the architecture of the  surrounding buildings. This is a very special and privileged area to live.

All the public transportation methods pass by here, the buses, trains and trams. The taxi pole is in front of the building. If you prefer walking there are beautiful routes around the area during the summer and also during the winter.

The garbage shelter is in the front court yard and the same apartment key opens the door to enter there. There you can find different recycling containers for organic waste, glass, plastic, metal, paper, carton and mixed waste. You MUST take your trash here or otherwise leave it inside the apartment. It is not allowed to leave garbage in the hallways or green areas in the building. Another MUST is to keep silent from 10 pm to 7 am, this includes loud talking in the hallways, music, slamming the doors etc. It is very important we don't cause trouble to other neighbors. Now, if another neighbor is causing trouble to you call me immediately +358 44 9876 431 and I will solve the problem.",This neighborhood is very special for the beauty of the landscape of Kaisaniemi park and the architecture of the  surrounding buildings.

My studio is on the 4th floor in the 5-floored building equipped with an elevator.

The place is suitable for 2-3 people with a 160 cm double bed and a sofa can be turned into a  130 cm bed for the third guest.

There is a big sofa table and with the wifi included, I hope, that can assist in your work.

The kitchen is rather tiny but it is almost fully-equipped (no oven) that you can find also a toaster, a coffeemaker within the place.

The shower is also a bit small, but enough with shampoo, shower gel, and conditioner to fresh yourselves before the day begins or after a long day.

The laundry is on the ground floor that you can use it. However, you will need to book the time in the laundry room if there is any free space. There is a small fee for using it € 0.99-€1.82 each time use. You will find the instruction in the laundry room. The fee would be paid by your phone bill.

There is also a small and peaceful park behind the building that you will find a relaxing place with fresh air there.

Our apartment is big part of Kerava's history. The house is at least 100years old so you have to understand that there are noisy nuisances due to its location!!!! :) 
Our apartment is especially suitable for families and travelers! :) 

Huoneistomme sopii hyvin perheille ja työporukalle kuin myös yksikseen matkaaville jotka viihtyvät tilavassa huoneistossa :) 
Huoneistomme on pala Keravan historiaa ja paritalon ulkokuori on rakennettu n. 1928-luvulla.

Talo on suojeltu ja hyvin vanha joten vieraiden täytyy ymmärtää että huoneistoon kuuluu selkeästi radan läheisyydestä ja tiestä aiheutuvat melut, näihin asioihin emme pysty itse vaikuttamaan. Joten jos ei ole kokemusta junan äänistä ja melu ei tulisi täytenä yllätyksenä niin varaathan huoneiston jostain muualta! :) SUOSITTELEN!!!

Paikkaansa nähden hyvin rauhallisella alueella, vaikka vilkas tie vieressä sekä junaraide menee talon aidan vierestä max.10m ja helsinki-vantaan lentoreitti menee talon ylitse :) 
Näiden ansiosta kuitenkin kulkuyhteydet mitä parhaimmat niin Helsingiin kuin Lahden suntaan. 

Prisma sijaitsee aivan kadun toisella puolella ja se on auki 24h joten vaikka kuinka myöhään saavut huoneistoon, aina löytyy kauppa josta ostaa ruokaa sekä välttämättömyystarvikkeita! :)

And if you want bigger shops Jumbo/Flamingo shopping center (adress: Vantaanportinkatu 3/ Tasetie 8) is a great place to visit, 15 min drive to Jumbo/flamingo by car. and if you like an Asian Thai food, you must visit restaurant Tamarin Thai cuisine in the Jumbo mall. :)

This is one of the most wanted areas in Helsinki to live in - Ullalinna. While being so close to the touristy center, it's quiet and just perfect for trying out some of the best local cuisine and finding unique items in the little shops. It's also part of the Desing district of Helsinki, which is presented by the local clothes' and interior designers, who keep their own shops in the area. There is plenty of little galleries, the Design museum of Helsinki and, of course, the very typical Helsinki architecture in Jugend style.
Only 15min walk to the seaside also! What can be more relaxing than a walk along the sealine or having a lunch with a view.

Most of the things can be and should be covered on foot: all main attractions, the shopping streets and the central train station are all within 15min walk.
There are few buses and trams going through the area too (tram 10 and bus 24 sop just outside the houes and go along Mannerheimintie, stop close to the trains tation. Also buses 14, 18, 17 and trams 3, 1A stop within 2min walk).

It's a residential area, therefore some quite hours have to be honored: keep the noise low between 22pm and 7am.
No smoking is allowed inside the building.
No pets are allowed due to possible allergies.
The shoes should be taken off when inside.
If somehting gets broken or damaged, the compensation will be expeced from the guests.
If the key is lost or stolen, the change of locks will also be charged from the guest.","This is one of the most wanted areas in Helsinki to live in - Ullalinna.

Many famous local actors and artists live in this neighborhood.  Shops and restaurants are near and you will find the area very safe and clean.  Oulunkylä means Oulun's Village - the locals are proud of keeping this part of the city green with lots of trees and showing that they are friendly ""village people"".

You will find that public transport is the highlight of this location.   You can get to everywhere in the city in just a few minutes. Oulunkylä train-station is one of the biggest junctions for east-west and north-south lines.  The train station is a 3 min walk away and only 10 mins to the heart of Helsinki by train. Trains run often.  The major 550 EAST to WEST express bus stop is only a 4min walk away.   If you are flying in, you can basically jump on the airport express train and then walk to our door.

Excellent restaurants, bars, nightclub, shops, grocery store, pharmacy, pizzeria, 24h burger joint, and R-kioski (convenience store)  just a 1-2 min walk down the road.

This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area. In summer time different happenings and concerts are organized in the Kaisaniemi Park, which you can see for free from your living room window. It is a very secure and safe area to go around even in late hours of the night. The regular inhabitants of the building are mostly elderly people who want to enjoy their retirement and a quiet life.

One of the best things about staying here is that everything is so close that you can get there on foot! If not the buses, trains, cabs and metro are right next door. The best bars and restaurants and shopping malls are right here as well as the biggest movie houses and even the National Theater is in the next block.

There are four important details about living in Finland:
1) Always take off your shoes when you enter into a home.
2) You must respect silence after 10 pm until 7 am and avoid music or loud speaking and laughing or using noisy appliances (blender). The neighbors easily call the police and they show up at once.
3) Keep your voice down also when circulating in general areas of the building.
4) The carbage must be left in the carbage shelter at the inside court yard only.","This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area.

(Website hidden by Airbnb)

The natural beauty of Lake Tuusula attracted many masters of art, music and literature, and it is this which makes the area one of a kind in Finland. The golden age of Finnish art is brought to life at home museums which take the visitor back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. In addition to historical cultural sights, events and exhibitions, the area offers museums for those interested in military history. 
The homes of the artists who lived here take you back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. It has also been home to many famous Finns; Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Venny Soldan-Brofeldt, J.H. Erkko, Eino Leino, Eero Järnefelt, Pekka Halonen and the Sibelius Academy’s Kallio-Kuninkala College.

The lake and its surrounding area offer great experiences for both summer and winter activities. Cycling around Lake Tuusula is very popular activity. Beautiful scenery, historical sights and safe cycle paths attract both locals and visitors alike to cycle this circular 26 km / 16 mile route. In addition, the lake is ideal for fishing and rowing, paddling, sailing, ice-skating, icefishing (we can borrow you some equipments) and skiing – and for swimming on a hot summer’s day. You can also find walking paths in the forest.
We can borrow a bike if you want to go around the lake and stop at the attractions and advise where you can rent boats, canoes, SUP boards etc.

The huge shopping mall Jumbo in Vantaa (14 km) is reachable by bus in 30-40 minutes and by car in 15-20 minutes from the house. It is offering a great variety of shops and restaurants and an amazing waterpark and quiet spa center Flamingo.

 The area of Käpylä, the famous suburb of wooden buildings, was built in early 1920´s when there was a bad housing problem for workers in the city. It was   designed to be a model workers’ housing area and it became known as the earliest example in Finland of the Garden City Movement. Since then, Käpylä has become a popular residential area for artists, actors and architects while it enjoys a reputation of a famous tourist attraction.


Käpylä has excellent connections to the city centre by tram, bus and local train (Pasila station). Buses to the city centre and airport run even through the night. The fair ground - Helsinki Convention Center- is just stone´s throw away.

Hei sinä!
Oletko  elämässäsi väsynyt ja kuormittunut tai kenties onnesi kukkuloilla ja auringonsäteet valaisevat tietäsi?Vai elätkö elämää, jota jotkut kutsuvat tavalliseksi? 

Olipa tilanteesi minkälainen tahansa niin tiedän, että jokainen kulkija ansaitsee elämässään ripauksen luksusta. Ansaitsee yön, jonka nukkua laadukkaassa tempory- sängyssä, niin ettei kaupungin melu häiritse, vaikka nukutkin ihan ydinkeskustassa. Hetken, jolloin istua keinutuolissa ja juoda aamukahvia kauniista posliinikupposesta. 

Ja kun seurani alkaa kyllästyttää tai muuten vain tahdot aistia ympärilläsi olevaa kauneutta pääset luotani helposti pois. Juna-asema on vieressäni ja metrot kulkevat alapuolellani. 

Olen vanha,  varmasti paljon vanhempi kuin sinä.  Moni on tullut kylään ja lähtenyt. Yksi on ollut seuranani päivän ja toinen kutsuu minua kodikseen. 
Elämän matkaajaa minä ymmärrän ja siksi toivotan sinut tervetulleeksi luokseni. 

Terveisin, majatalo

The natural beauty of Lake Tuusula attracted many masters of art, music and literature, and it is this which makes the area one of a kind in Finland. The golden age of Finnish art is brought to life at home museums which take the visitor back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. In addition to historical cultural sights, events and exhibitions, the area offers museums for those interested in military history. 
The homes of the artists who lived here take you back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. It has also been home to many famous Finns; Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Venny Soldan-Brofeldt, J.H. Erkko, Eino Leino, Eero Järnefelt, Pekka Halonen and the Sibelius Academy’s Kallio-Kuninkala College.

The lake and its surrounding area offer great experiences for both summer and winter activities. Cycling around Lake Tuusula is very popular activity. Beautiful scenery, historical sights and safe cycle paths attract both locals and visitors alike to cycle this circular 26 km / 16 mile route. In addition, the lake is ideal for fishing and rowing, paddling, sailing, ice-skating, icefishing (we can borrow you some equipments) and skiing – and for swimming on a hot summer’s day. You can also find walking paths in the forest.
We can borrow a bike if you want to go around the lake and stop at the attractions and advise where you can rent boats, canoes, SUP boards etc.

The huge shopping mall Jumbo in Vantaa (14 km) is reachable by bus in 30-40 minutes and by car in 15-20 minutes from the house. It is offering a great variety of shops and restaurants and an amazing waterpark and quiet spa center Flamingo.
