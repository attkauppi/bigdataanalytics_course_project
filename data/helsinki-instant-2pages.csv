We have an ecological theme for the apartment. In practice this means:
* organic soaps, shampoo, dishwashers, coffee, cooking oil etc. 
* renewable electricity
* cotton bags are available for when you go shopping
* recycling is encouraged and made easy

Kamppi is closest residential area to the city center, which means that the main sights, museums, shopping, restaurants and bars are within a walking distance.

The apartment is close to several bus and tram stops and only a few minutes walk from the metro and bus station at Kamppi. The Central Railway Station where the airport train arrives, is less than a kilometer away (a one minute metro ride). The West Harbour is just four stops away with the tram 7.

Update Tuesday 31 March. We hosts have been healthy, follow best practices to avoid infections and we have taken extra steps to make the apartment safe for guests like disinfecting all taps, doorknobs and light switches between guests, and making sure there is hand soap available.

We live in the same building and work close by, which makes it easy to arrange luggage storage if you arrive before check-in or leave late on check-out day.","Kamppi is closest residential area to the city center, which means that the main sights, museums, shopping, restaurants and bars are within a walking distance.","Update Tuesday 31 March.

Update 13 Mar: we have taken extra steps to make the apartment as safe as possible from the coronavirus

We have an ecological theme for the apartment. In practice this means:
* organic soaps, shampoo, dishwashers, coffee, cooking oil etc. 
* renewable electricity
* cotton bags are available for when you go shopping
* recycling is encouraged and made easy

Kamppi is closest residential area to the city center, which means that the main sights, museums, shopping, restaurants and bars are within a walking distance.

The apartment is close to several bus and tram stops and only a few minutes walk from the metro and bus station at Kamppi. The Central Railway Station where the airport train arrives, is less than a kilometer away (a one minute metro ride). The West Harbour is just four stops away with the tram 7.

Update Tuesday 31 March. We hosts have been healthy, follow best practices to avoid infections and we have taken extra steps to make the apartment safe for guests like disinfecting all taps, doorknobs and light switches between guests, and making sure there is hand soap available.

We live in the same building and work close by, which makes it easy to arrange luggage storage if you arrive before check-in or leave late on check-out day.","Kamppi is closest residential area to the city center, which means that the main sights, museums, shopping, restaurants and bars are within a walking distance.","Update Tuesday 31 March.

Please try to leave the apartment tidy as we don't charge a cleaning fee and have often a limited time to clean between guests.

If you arrive to Helsinki by plane you can reach the apartment by a direct train from the airport terminal at a cost of 5 euros. The trains takes about 30 minutes to arrive to the Main Railway Station in Helsinki. From there you can walk to the apartment in a couple of minutes. You can also take a bus, which leaves you at the Railway Square, also very close.
A taxi cab will charge you around 50 to 60 euros depending what time you arrive. For groups of max. three persons I can provide personal pick up service any time at 35 euros one way from the airport. 

If you come by boat from any of the three harbours you can take the tram 1,70 euros and get off at the Main Railway Station stop. Walk a couple of minutes and you are there.

If you come by bus from other cities in Finland and arrive to Kamppi bus station, you can take the underground from there to Helsinki University Metro Station (second stop) or walk about 10 minutes.

I always try to receive the guests personally and hand over the keys, after which I can be reached by phone or Airbnb page. My guests can always reach me if they have any specific questions about the stay.

This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area. In summer time different happenings and concerts are organized in the Kaisaniemi Park, which you can see for free from your living room window. It is a very secure and safe area to go around even in late hours of the night. The regular inhabitants of the building are mostly elderly people who want to enjoy their retirement and a quiet life.

One of the best things about staying here is that everything is so close that you can get there on foot! If not the buses, trains, cabs and metro are right next door. The best bars and restaurants and shopping malls are right here as well as the biggest movie houses and even the National Theater is in the next block.

There are four important details about living in Finland:
1) Always take off your shoes when you enter into a home.
2) You must respect silence after 10 pm until 7 am and avoid music or loud speaking and laughing or using noisy appliances (blender). The neighbors easily call the police and they show up at once.
3) Keep your voice down also when circulating in general areas of the building.
4) The carbage must be left in the carbage shelter at the inside court yard only.","This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area.

The natural beauty of Lake Tuusula attracted many masters of art, music and literature, and it is this which makes the area one of a kind in Finland. The golden age of Finnish art is brought to life at home museums which take the visitor back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. In addition to historical cultural sights, events and exhibitions, the area offers museums for those interested in military history. 
The homes of the artists who lived here take you back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. It has also been home to many famous Finns; Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Venny Soldan-Brofeldt, J.H. Erkko, Eino Leino, Eero Järnefelt, Pekka Halonen and the Sibelius Academy’s Kallio-Kuninkala College.

The lake and its surrounding area offer great experiences for both summer and winter activities. Cycling around Lake Tuusula is very popular activity. Beautiful scenery, historical sights and safe cycle paths attract both locals and visitors alike to cycle this circular 26 km / 16 mile route. In addition, the lake is ideal for fishing and rowing, paddling, sailing, ice-skating, icefishing (we can borrow you some equipments) and skiing – and for swimming on a hot summer’s day. You can also find walking paths in the forest.
We can borrow a bike if you want to go around the lake and stop at the attractions and advise where you can rent boats, canoes, SUP boards etc.

The huge shopping mall Jumbo in Vantaa (14 km) is reachable by bus in 30-40 minutes and by car in 15-20 minutes from the house. It is offering a great variety of shops and restaurants and an amazing waterpark and quiet spa center Flamingo.

* organic soaps, shampoo, dishwashers, coffee, cooking oil etc.

* cotton bags are available for when you go shopping
* recycling is encouraged and made easy

Kamppi is closest residential area to the city center, which means that the main sights, museums, shopping, restaurants and bars are within a walking distance.

Update Tuesday 31 March. We hosts have been healthy, follow best practices to avoid infections and we have taken extra steps to make the apartment safe for guests like disinfecting all taps, doorknobs and light switches between guests, and making sure there is hand soap available.

We live in the same building and work close by, which makes it easy to arrange luggage storage if you arrive before check-in or leave late on check-out day.","Kamppi is closest residential area to the city center, which means that the main sights, museums, shopping, restaurants and bars are within a walking distance.","Update Tuesday 31 March.

This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area. In summer time different happenings and concerts are organized in the Kaisaniemi Park, which you can see for free from your living room window. It is a very secure and safe area to go around even in late hours of the night. The regular inhabitants of the building are mostly elderly people who want to enjoy their retirement and a quiet life.

One of the best things about staying here is that everything is so close that you can get there on foot! If not the buses, trains, cabs and metro are right next door. The best bars and restaurants and shopping malls are right here as well as the biggest movie houses and even the National Theater is in the next block.

There are four important details about living in Finland:
1) Always take off your shoes when you enter into a home.
2) You must respect silence after 10 pm until 7 am and avoid music or loud speaking and laughing or using noisy appliances (blender). The neighbors easily call the police and they show up at once.
3) Keep your voice down also when circulating in general areas of the building.
4) The carbage must be left in the carbage shelter at the inside court yard only.","This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area.

The natural beauty of Lake Tuusula attracted many masters of art, music and literature, and it is this which makes the area one of a kind in Finland. The golden age of Finnish art is brought to life at home museums which take the visitor back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. In addition to historical cultural sights, events and exhibitions, the area offers museums for those interested in military history. 
The homes of the artists who lived here take you back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. It has also been home to many famous Finns; Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Venny Soldan-Brofeldt, J.H. Erkko, Eino Leino, Eero Järnefelt, Pekka Halonen and the Sibelius Academy’s Kallio-Kuninkala College.

The lake and its surrounding area offer great experiences for both summer and winter activities. Cycling around Lake Tuusula is very popular activity. Beautiful scenery, historical sights and safe cycle paths attract both locals and visitors alike to cycle this circular 26 km / 16 mile route. In addition, the lake is ideal for fishing and rowing, paddling, sailing, ice-skating, icefishing (we can borrow you some equipments) and skiing – and for swimming on a hot summer’s day. You can also find walking paths in the forest.
We can borrow a bike if you want to go around the lake and stop at the attractions and advise where you can rent boats, canoes, SUP boards etc.

The huge shopping mall Jumbo in Vantaa (14 km) is reachable by bus in 30-40 minutes and by car in 15-20 minutes from the house. It is offering a great variety of shops and restaurants and an amazing waterpark and quiet spa center Flamingo.

Ahdas, pelkistetty ja askeettisen vanhanaikainen tupakeittiö jakaantuu osiin makuuparven jyrkkien portaiden toimesta. Ruotsin väreihin sonnustettu makkari ei vedä vertoja Viking Linen D-kannen kapyyseille, mutta pysyy kuitenkin pahemmin keinumatta rajummallakaan tuulella. Makuuparven valitseva todistaa rohkeutensa jo ekstrajyrkissä portaissa, joiden yläpäässä odottaa rusehtavan väsähtänyt loukko. Paras sulkea silmänsä vain äkkiä ja nukkua aamuun, jotta voi laskeutua pois parvelta vessaan tai suihkuun, jotka molemmat mahtuvat pesukoneen, saunan ja pesualtaan sekaan.

Transportation
The best way to get over from the airport to the apartment is by I train. It is a 10-15 minute walk from the closest railway station Huopalahti to the apartment.
You can always use the taxi but it is a bit tricky since you have to agree on the price beforehand – they can charge you up to 100 euro if you do not do so. It is also hard to compare the different companies, since some charge by time, some by kilometer, some by time of day… If you decide to use the taxi, I would recommend Taksi Helsinki since they are the most reliable one. You can either agree on the price beforehand (via their app) or travel by meter. Either is fine. If you use Taksi Helsinki it should cost approximately 40 euros from the airport to the apartment.

I am available by phone and email during your stay, and in case of emergency also in person.

The neighborhood is peaceful and quiets down early in the evening. During summer time, you can sit in the yard or have a picnic on the small hill behind the yard. There are also a lot of parks in the area. The houses are built detached, which gives a lot of airiness and light, so it is a nice place for walks or running.

It is just a 10 min train ride or a 15 min bus or tram ride to the center of the city (10 min walk to tram stop, bus stop across the street) and to the airport by train 30 min + 10 min walk to station.","The neighborhood is peaceful and quiets down early in the evening.

This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area. In summer time different happenings and concerts are organized in the Kaisaniemi Park, which is next door. It is a very secure and safe area to go around even in late hours of the night. The regular inhabitants of the building are mostly elderly people who want to enjoy their retirement and a quiet life.

One of the best things about staying here is that everything is so close that you can get there on foot! If not, the buses, trains, cabs and metro are right next door. The best bars and restaurants and shopping malls are right here as well as the biggest movie houses and even the National Theater is in the next block. Parking a car can sometimes be challenging in the downtown area, that is why we a covered indoors parking lot at your disposal for an extra cost.

There are four important details about living in Finland:
1) Always take off your shoes when you enter into a home.
2) You must respect silence after 10 pm until 7 am and avoid music or loud speaking and laughing or using noisy appliances (blender). The neighbors easily call the police and they show up at once.
3) Keep your voice down also when circulating in general areas of the building.
4) The garbage must be left in the garbage shelter at the inside court yard only. The bottles and cans can be left in the pin inside the apartment for the recycling purpose.","This is a very quiet neighborhood in spite of being in the downtown area.

Keittiö on alkukantaisen pieni ja ahdas - opettaa arvostamaan avoimia tiloja.
Olohuone on ainut osa tölliä, missä on lokoisat tilat kölliä.
Makuuhuone on pienen tai erityisen nöyrän ystävä - jo rappusten yläpäästä on kumarrettava huoneen kruununjalokivelle, sängylle. Yläkerrassa on lisäksi linnantornia hyvällä mielikuvituksella etäisesti muistuttava vaatehuone, tyrmä tai lasten kammari.

My place will allow you feel comfortable, cook your own food, come and go any time you want. It's clean, quiet, easy to access and has everything you need for a stay away from home. The apartment's layout with the loft bed can accommodate four people without making it feel crowded. 
What is great about this place, that it is right in the center, but somehow deeper into the streets, where you can see local people's life going on. There are local cafes and bars, where neigbourhood's residents like to go, children's playground, interesting little shops, the streets are narrower and tourists are not seen as often.
Let me know, what your are looking for and expecting from your stay, and I will do my best to make it feel just right for you!
Baby crib available on request (extra charge 15eur/stay).

The entire apartment is for you to use. If sleeping on a loft-bed is not your thing, the sofa easily coverts into a nice double bed.

Hei sinä!
Oletko  elämässäsi väsynyt ja kuormittunut tai kenties onnesi kukkuloilla ja auringonsäteet valaisevat tietäsi?Vai elätkö elämää, jota jotkut kutsuvat tavalliseksi? 

Olipa tilanteesi minkälainen tahansa niin tiedän, että jokainen kulkija ansaitsee elämässään ripauksen luksusta. Ansaitsee yön, jonka nukkua laadukkaassa tempory- sängyssä, niin ettei kaupungin melu häiritse, vaikka nukutkin ihan ydinkeskustassa. Hetken, jolloin istua keinutuolissa ja juoda aamukahvia kauniista posliinikupposesta. 

Ja kun seurani alkaa kyllästyttää tai muuten vain tahdot aistia ympärilläsi olevaa kauneutta pääset luotani helposti pois. Juna-asema on vieressäni ja metrot kulkevat alapuolellani. 

Olen vanha,  varmasti paljon vanhempi kuin sinä.  Moni on tullut kylään ja lähtenyt. Yksi on ollut seuranani päivän ja toinen kutsuu minua kodikseen. 
Elämän matkaajaa minä ymmärrän ja siksi toivotan sinut tervetulleeksi luokseni. 

Terveisin, majatalo

The natural beauty of Lake Tuusula attracted many masters of art, music and literature, and it is this which makes the area one of a kind in Finland. The golden age of Finnish art is brought to life at home museums which take the visitor back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. In addition to historical cultural sights, events and exhibitions, the area offers museums for those interested in military history. 
The homes of the artists who lived here take you back to the heyday of the Finnish National Romantic era at the turn of the 20th century. It has also been home to many famous Finns; Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Venny Soldan-Brofeldt, J.H. Erkko, Eino Leino, Eero Järnefelt, Pekka Halonen and the Sibelius Academy’s Kallio-Kuninkala College.

The lake and its surrounding area offer great experiences for both summer and winter activities. Cycling around Lake Tuusula is very popular activity. Beautiful scenery, historical sights and safe cycle paths attract both locals and visitors alike to cycle this circular 26 km / 16 mile route. In addition, the lake is ideal for fishing and rowing, paddling, sailing, ice-skating, icefishing (we can borrow you some equipments) and skiing – and for swimming on a hot summer’s day. You can also find walking paths in the forest.
We can borrow a bike if you want to go around the lake and stop at the attractions and advise where you can rent boats, canoes, SUP boards etc.

The huge shopping mall Jumbo in Vantaa (14 km) is reachable by bus in 30-40 minutes and by car in 15-20 minutes from the house. It is offering a great variety of shops and restaurants and an amazing waterpark and quiet spa center Flamingo.
