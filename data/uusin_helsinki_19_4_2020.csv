Neither smoking nor pets are allowed in the apartment.

Please do not get trouble to the host by downloading from Torrents, DC++ etc. He will be sued if his guests use his internet for illegal purposes.

Despite the apartment's central location, this early 20th century house is the home of ordinary Helsinki people who have kids and go to work the next morning. Normal socializing in night time has never been a problem but please no crazy parties with loud music during the week... You will make me happy by leaving the apartment in the same condition as you had it when arriving, except for dishes and laundry which you can leave for me to take care of.

To protect the floor from scratches and the carpet from dirt, please take off your shoes at the door step before going in to the apartment. In Finland, it is generally considered as a good manner to take off shoes when entering homes.

Don't switch off the fan of the hood over the stove. That fan takes care of the ventilation in the whole apartment.

Frying a beef or making pop corn in the traditional ways on the stove are not good ideas because the whole apartment will then smell several days after. Other methods of cooking are encouraged.

LAUNDRY MACHINE
- DON’T FORGET TO UNPLUG THE LAUNDRY MACHINE AFTER YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR CLOTHES. The shower is just beside the washing machine.
- Close the water tap coming to the laundry machine after using the machine.
- DON’T MOVE THE WASHING MACHINE! It has been balanced on the sloping floor and rebalancing it is a real challenge….
- Turn of the machine before adjusting the program.

Coffee machine, toaster, iron etc. you’ll find from cupboards. If you need a vacuum cleaner, you should mention about it before arrival to the apartment.

If you are visiting my home in Wednesday evening, there is a sauna reservation for that evening at 10-11 p.m. for me. Please do not hesitate to use it. The sauna is downstairs in the basement and you will get in by using the house key.",You can call me or my brother in a case of emergency. We are staying half an hour away.,The whole apartment is for the guests.,"Many busses and trams have their stops just around the corner. There is also a taxi stop just 150 meters away.

Because of the very central location, car parking is relatively expensive. 24 hours parking costs 32-36 euro depending on the parking facility. Short time street parking is also subject to a charge.

Avis and Budget car rentals have their office 400 m away from the apartment. Address Malminkatu 24.",,,

Kruununhaka (or Krunikka) is right by the downtown area but has its own distinct feeling, more quiet and calm. The area is very uniform architecturally and it is worthwhile to explore the old houses and the numerous antiques and second hand shops.

There is also a tram stop located just around the corner. Straight train connection to airport from the Central Railway Station, which is accessible with tram (or a 15-min walk).

Kamppi is a district in the middle of downtown Helsinki. The name Kamppi derives from the Swedish Kampen, which referred to the military training field in the area. Kamppi was mainly built into a wooden house district for workers, although the houses surrounding Bulevardi were quite luxurious.

The busiest spot in Kamppi is the Kamppi Centre, which opened in 2006. The complex has become a meeting point for young people and includes a shopping centre, a bus terminal, metro station, plenty of restaurants, as well as apartments. 

Kamppi stretches all the way to the Hietalahti Market Square and the sea. The long street called Fredrikinkatu is dotted with little shops and sights on Kalevankatu include old wooden houses such as one housing the School Museum. The area also has many office buildings as over 26,000 people work there daily. The Hietalahti Market Hall graces the market square and boasts numerous restaurants. The working class past of Kamppi is never far: the wooden houses called Sadan markan villat ('One hundred mark villas') are still lived in.

From the Central Railway station you can take tram 6, 7 and 9, which all conveniently stops a couple of blocks away from the apartment. You can also come straight from the West Terminal to the apartment with tram 7 or 9. 
Many trams stops within one or two blocks away from the apartment (tram number 6, 7, 9). Also excellent bus connections to most parts of Espoo just around the corner. Closest metro stop is Kamppi (which you can access with tram 7 and 9).

The streets around the apartment offer paid parking for four euros per hour. Easiest way to pay for your parking is by downloading e.g. the EasyPark app for your smartphone (requires registration first). Keep in mind that it can be tricky to find a spot around the block of the apartment. There is also a nearby garage (three blocks away) that offers parking for around 40-45€/day.","Kamppi is a district in the middle of downtown Helsinki.

PROVIDING A SAFE STAY FOR MY GUESTS DESPITE COVID-19

Due to COVID-19 pandemic I have taken several extra precautions, here are the most important ones:

* I do not stay or visit the apartment or allow other visit (maintenance, cleaning, etc.) during guests stay. This is unless specifically requested by the guests and the most safe way to do this is planned together.

* I recommend self check-in and check-out, so no contact between the guests and myself is needed.

* I make sure that before and after each stay the apartment is carefully cleaned and especially frequently touched surfaces are carefully disinfected.

* I also leave the apartment to be empty for at least 48 hours after guests leave and before the next guests arrive. This is to follow the CDC recommendations and to exceed them (they recommend 24 hours). The purpose is to protect people in case the virus has entered the apartment and manages to live on surfaces. 

* I wash all the bed sheets, blankets and towels before and after each stay at the highest heat setting possible recommended by the manufacturer, or I exceed it.

* I ventilate the apartment before and after each stay.

* Guests are provided a hand sanitizer, disinfectant spray for surfaces and a new cleaning cloth, so disinfecting your hands and surfaces in the apartment before and after you use them is as easy as possible.","Near the sea and great jogging paths in the nature!
