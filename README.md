# big data analytics course project

This repository contains a jupyter notebooks, where price prediction models are developed for both predicting prices in Helsinki and in Manchester. Manchester was added to see, if the approach worked with a larger dataset. Also, the Helsinki dataset was collected in April 2020, when the Uusimaa region was in lockdown, which may've resulted in the dataset being very small - about 200 listings.

Additionally, this repository contains a flask server, which can be used to test the predictions given by the price prediction model.
